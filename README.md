Project Overview:

The project is a CUDA-based game where two GPUs compete against each other. For this example,I'll use a game of Connect 4. Each GPU represents a player in the game, and they each employ their own strategies to make moves. The game board and moves will be represented and updated on the GPU, with results being communicated to the host (CPU) for display and replay.

Goals:

Implement a Connect 4 game with two competing GPUs.
Each GPU will use its own strategy (e.g., random moves, heuristic-based moves).
Develop a system to track and visualize the gameâ€™s progress.
Provide a replay mechanism for the game to be reviewed and analyzed.
High-Level Structure:

Initialization:

Allocate memory on the GPU for the game board.
Initialize game state and strategies for both GPUs.
Game Logic:

Define CUDA kernels for making moves and updating the game board.
Implement logic for checking for win conditions and game status.
Strategies:

GPU 1: Random Move Strategy.
GPU 2: Simple Heuristic Strategy (e.g., blocking opponent's winning move or trying to win).
Game Management:

Manage turns between GPUs.
Synchronize GPU computations with the host to track the game status.
Replay and Visualization:

Record each move and game state.
Implement functionality to replay the game either through a CLI or graphical presentation.
Specific Algorithms and Kernels:

Move Kernel: A kernel function that allows a GPU to make a move and update the board. This involves selecting a column, placing a disc, and updating the board array.

Win Check Kernel: A kernel function that checks for win conditions (e.g., four discs in a row) after each move.

Game Status Kernel: A kernel function that checks the game status (e.g., ongoing, win, draw).

Note:

The kernels provided are very basic. You will need to implement the full logic for moves, win checks, and game management.
For a complete game, you would need additional code for managing turns, implementing strategies, and handling game state updates.
